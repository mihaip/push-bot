PuSH Bot lets you receive notifications via XMPP of updates to feeds that support [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) (commonly abbreviated to PuSH). This means that you can receive updates from Blogger, TypePad, Movable Type and LiveJournal blogs, any FeedBurner feed and many other sources to Google Talk or any other Jabber/XMPP account.

It is running at [push-bot.appspot.com](http://push-bot.appspot.com/).
